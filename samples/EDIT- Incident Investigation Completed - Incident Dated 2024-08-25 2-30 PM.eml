dysregulation (approved by father)NameIna MaraearaRoleHLAdditional information
not included in the initial incident report.People: HL spoke to SW face to face
on the day of the incident. Feedback, resident was getting sick. He had a bad
cough. He was upset the whole day. No known trigger handover given by the
resident parents.
Process: SW followed BSB. 
System: HL reviewed shift notes and data collection.OtherI confirm that I have
assessed this incident, spoken to relevant staff, and can confirm all protocols
and procedures were followed. This incident is typical, ongoing behaviour which
is expected to continue, and is understood by family, support staff and
clinicians; subsequently, it appears unlikely this incident was avoidable in any
way. The only action available will be to monitor the frequency and intensity of
these incidents with the participant's MDT and support networks.Status of the
