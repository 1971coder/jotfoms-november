had the resident been doing? How was the participant's mood? What were the other
resident doing? What were staff doing? How many staff were present? What were
the likely triggers?)At start of shift, 3pm, staff observed both day staff and
Will standing outside the front door, on the patio. Will was crying and hitting
the stone with his hand. During the hand over, day staff reported that Will did
not have a good day. He's been crying alot, kicking in the car. Will had been
given 1 PRN dose about 12 noon. Will had declined to eat his lunch today. Lunch
today was McDonald's,  which is one of his prefered meal. Describe the
incident/ allegation (Please provide all details including names of staff,
location of incident (e.g which room in the House or venue), actions by all
involved)Staff was hoping the Will would calm down with the change of staff.
Which he did for some time. Ate his afternoon tea, took 3pm medication. 3:50pm
Will became elevated and dysregulated. He was crying, head butting the door
frame, stomping his feet, saying "No, No," Hitting objects with his hand. 

Staff kept any objects that could harm the resident away. 

Staff called Will's dad to get permission to give PRN medication. Permission was
granted. PRN given. Will calmed down after some 30 to 40 minutes. Will sat in
the lounge room to watch tv. He was still vocal, but the frequency and volume
was reducing gradually. 

18:20 pm staff and Will are preparing dinner in the kitchen. Staff gave Will
some space. Will was in the kitchen staff was in the room next door. Just as
staff was coming back in the kitchen the two met in the corridor. Maybe they
were both startled or too close. Will tried to hit the staff with his hand. He
tired to scratch the staff. Staff backed away moved to the front door, opened
and went outside. 
Will tried severally to approach the staff. Staff used the extra space outside
to keep at least 1.5m away from Will. 18:28 staff called Will's dad for
permission to give PRN again. Permission was granted. 18:45 staff gave Will PRN
medication.  Immediate action taken (Provide details of the immediate steps
taken)Staff tried to wait and see if Will would calm down, spoke calmly with
Will. Tried to find out what the problem was. Staff gave Will time and space.
Staff offered Will a cup of water. Staff gave Will hugs when required to help
him calm down. When things escalated staff called the parents to get permission
to give PRN medication.Given the behaviour displayed in this incident, what does
the behaviour support plan say to do?I believe I've mentioned these aboveWere
these strategies effective?YesWould you like more training on the behaviour
support plan directly from the behaviour support clinician and your manager? (If
you select yes, an email will be sent to your manager and behaviour support
clinician.)NoIf not, why not?I'm open to learning new ways to support the
resident better.What could have been differently? Suggested action that be can
be taken to lower the risk of future incidents.Resident was elevated at start of
shift. Staff could only try to calm him down. How did you debrief with the
resident after the incident?Staff  both completed the evening routine. Resident
