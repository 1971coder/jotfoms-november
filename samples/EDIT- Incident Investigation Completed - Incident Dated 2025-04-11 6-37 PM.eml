Who is this incident report about?Will WhiteIncident Management StageAssess an
incidentDate & time you became aware of the incident2025-04-11 6:37 PMHow many
staff were present at the time of the incident1Who was, or potentially was
impacted by the incident? If there was more than one person with disability
impacted by the incident, a separate form must be completed for each
participantResidentName of person impacted (This includes residents, staff,
family and community members)William WhiteWHS: Did the incident cause you to
feel unsafe, or present a physical or psychological risk to you, the resident,
or other staff?NoWhat were the circumstances leading up to the incident? (What
had the resident been doing? How was the participant's mood? What were the other
resident doing? What were staff doing? How many staff were present? What were
the likely triggers?)Will had been following his usual afternoon routine when he
got home, and he did have a good day today. Around 4pm when watching ABC kids,
Will began to make sad/crying sounds intermittently, engaging in rocking back
and forth, bending fingers, and eventually a few chin hits. He began to cry more
intensely closer to dinner time so I was hoping that it may have been the start
of him de-escalating and that there would be a turn around after having his
dinner, but he continued to engage in self-injurious behaviours during and after
dinner. Describe the incident/ allegation (Please provide all details including
names of staff, location of incident (e.g which room in the House or venue),
actions by all involved)During and after dinner, Will began to cry more
intensely and say "no", hit his forehead with his hand, he engaged in 3 bouts of
chin hitting with the back of his hand (5-6 hits each), and also hit the kitchen
walls with his arms. He had also hit the side of his chair while eating with his
arm. I contacted Allie to update her with how Will was going and let her know
that I felt he would continue to engage in self-injurious behaviors still after
dinner, and got consent for his 1st PRN at 6:37pmImmediate action taken (Provide
details of the immediate steps taken)Let Allie know 
Administered 1st PRN after dinner Given the behaviour displayed in this
incident, what does the behaviour support plan say to do?complete an incident
report 
Let parents know and get consent for PRNWere these strategies effective?YesWould
you like more training on the behaviour support plan directly from the behaviour
support clinician and your manager? (If you select yes, an email will be sent to
your manager and behaviour support clinician.)NoIf not, why not?N/AWhat could
have been differently? Suggested action that be can be taken to lower the risk
of future incidents.In future if I cover another staff member who is sick, when
I give Will his visual schedule for the afternoon I will say e.g. "Graeme is
sick, Kristal stay"How did you debrief with the resident after the incident?Told
Will I was sorry when he began to cry more intensely, offered "big hug" but Will
did not feel like it today. Let Will know that he will see mum and dad on
sunday. Type of incident (Tick all that apply)Damage to propertyExplained minor
injury of a person with a disabilityBehavioural incident e.g Self harm, Pica,
Emotional distressNear Miss (something occurred that without the intervention of
staff could have resulted in injury to the participant or another person)Was PRN

- Use of Chemical restraint (including PRN)- the use of medication or chemical
substance for the primary purpose of influencing a person’s behaviour. It does

DescriptionSelf Injurious behaviour- hitting self on forehead, chin and hitting
kitchen walls. NameIna MaraearaRoleHL Additional information not included in the
initial incident report.Resident had a good day with day staff. Due to change of
afternoon staff. Graeme called in sick Change of staff. This upset William. 
People: Spoke to SW via phone. Kristal feedback next time he will mention to
William when arrived at the house. Communicate to William other staff is sick. 
Process: All process and producer followed by staff. All Williams visuals were
changed. 
System: Williams wall visuals and schedule were changed in the morning. 
I thought Kristal handled the incident really well. She followed all producer
and followed William behaviour support plan. What factors Process Factors
contributed to the incident? (P3)Staffing / RosteringOtherI confirm that I have
assessed this incident, spoken to relevant staff, and can confirm all protocols
and procedures were followed. This incident is typical, ongoing behaviour which
is expected to continue, and is understood by family, support staff and
clinicians; subsequently, it appears unlikely this incident was avoidable in any
way. The only action available will be to monitor the frequency and intensity of
these incidents with the participant's MDT and support networks. Contributing
