training for 6/3/25
OtherI confirm that I have assessed this incident, spoken to relevant staff, and
can confirm all protocols and procedures were followed. This incident is
typical, ongoing behaviour which is expected to continue, and is understood by
family, support staff and clinicians; subsequently, it appears unlikely this
incident was avoidable in any way. The only action available will be to monitor
the frequency and intensity of these incidents with the participant's MDT and
support networks.Status of the investigationCompleted
