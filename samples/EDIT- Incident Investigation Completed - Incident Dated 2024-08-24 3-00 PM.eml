Who is this incident report about?Will WhiteIncident Management StageAssess an
incidentDate & time you became aware of the incident2024-08-24 3:00 PMHow many
staff were present at the time of the incident1Who was, or potentially was
impacted by the incident? If there was more than one person with disability
impacted by the incident, a separate form must be completed for each
participantResidentName of person impacted (This includes residents, staff,
family and community members)William  White Name of person impacted (This
includes residents, staff, family and community members)William  White What were
the circumstances leading up to the incident? (What had the resident been doing?
How was the participant's mood? What were the other resident doing? What were
staff doing? How many staff were present? What were the likely triggers?)When I
arrived for my shift, William was sitting on the couch crying and vocalising. I
sat with him, held his hand and offered a hug. After a while, William began
saying “no” out of context and stomping his feet. I left to administer his
afternoon medication and he continued to stomp intensely. William began saying
“iPad” while he continued to cry and followed me into the staff bedroom,
continuing to stomp his feet, cry and vocalise. William lightly banged his head
on the bed frame and began showing interest in the keyboard. I removed the
keyboard and mouse from the room to prevent it being damaged. 

William’s dyregulation escalated as he continued crying, vocalising and
stomping his feet. He ripped up a piece of paper, stomped on a plastic item and
began engaging in SIBs to his head and bridge of his nose. William began
verbalising “no train” and “no powerhouse museum”. Will banged his back
into the wall and began jumping with full force. Describe the incident/
allegation (Please provide all details including names of staff, location of
incident (e.g which room in the House or venue), actions by all involved)
William headbutted the desk with high intensity. I administered two tablets of
lorazepam at 4:05pm. William then went into his room, slamming the door, and
continued vocalising, yelling and banging on surfaces, William continued to cry
in his room. After 40 minutes, William returned to the lounge room where he
began crying intensely, vebalising “no Mummy” and “No Daddy”. I thanked
Will for telling me and Will began pointing to the draw where his iPad is kept.
I reminded William that it was broken but that it was ok and we might get a new
one soon. William began talking with staff and smiling and began to regulate.

What factors System Factors contributed to the incident? (P3)Information
management systemCommunication systemOtherI confirm that I have assessed this
incident, spoken to relevant staff, and can confirm all protocols and procedures
were followed. This incident is typical, ongoing behaviour which is expected to
continue, and is understood by family, support staff and clinicians;
subsequently, it appears unlikely this incident was avoidable in any way. The
only action available will be to monitor the frequency and intensity of these
incidents with the participant's MDT and support networks. Contributing
